Instructions:

>Install a full Ruby development environment
>Install Jekyll and bundler gems
 "gem install jekyll bundler"

>Change into your new directory

Command Line Usage
The Jekyll gem makes a jekyll executable available to you in your terminal.

You can use this command in a number of ways:

jekyll new - Creates a new Jekyll site with default gem-based theme
jekyll new --blank - Creates a new blank Jekyll site scaffold
jekyll build or jekyll b - Performs a one off build your site to ./_site (by default)
jekyll serve or jekyll s - Builds your site any time a source file changes and serves it locally
jekyll doctor - Outputs any deprecation or configuration issues
jekyll new-theme - Creates a new Jekyll theme scaffold
jekyll clean - Removes the generated site and metadata file
jekyll help - Shows help, optionally for a given subcommand, e.g. jekyll help build
Typically you’ll use jekyll serve while developing locally and jekyll build when you need to generate the site for production.

To change Jekyll’s default build behavior have a look through the configuration options.
